- frontend

### How to setup locally

#### Backend
- Navigate to the "backend" directory.
- Obtain a free Postgres connection string from https://aiven.io/ and add it to the ".env" file as "DATABASE_URL".
- Obtain a free Prisma connection string from https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate and add it to the "wrangler.toml" file under the Prisma connection pool as "DATABASE_URL".
- Set any value for the JWT secret and add it to the "wrangler.toml" file as "JWT_SECRET".
- Run "npm install".
- Run "npm run dev".
> Ensure that both the ".env" and "wrangler.toml" files are properly configured, as they are crucial for the environment setup of the serverless backend.

#### Frontend
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm run dev 

### Technologies & Libraries
